python-lockfile (1:0.10.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of version 0.9, the Python API in ‘lockfile’ breaks backward
  compatibility with older versions. From the upstream release notes:

    * The names of the three main classes have changed as follows:

        LinkFileLock -> LinkLockFile
        MkdirFileLock -> MkdirLockFile
        SQLiteFileLock -> SQLiteLockFile

  Any Python code written to use the names from older APIs will break in
  this version. Such code needs to be migrated to use the new names.
